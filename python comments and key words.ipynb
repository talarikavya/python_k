    "# FEATURES OF PYTHON\n",
    "*Easy to learn: Python is easy to learn and use.It is developer friendly and high-level programming language.\n",
    "*Expressive Language: Python language is more expressive means that is more understandable and readable.\n",
    "*Interpreted Language: Interprefer executes the code line by line at a time.The makes debugging easy and thus suitable for beginners.\n",
    "*Cross-platform Language: Python can run equally an different platform such as Windows,Linux,Unix and macintox...etc.So, We can that python in portable language.\n",
    "*Open Source: Python language is freely available at offical web address. The sources code is also available it is open source.\n",
    "*Object-Oriented Language: Python supports object oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence.\n",
    "*Extensible: It impliesthat other language such as CC++ can beused to complies the code and thus it can used further in our python code.\n",
    "*Large stardard Libary: Python has large and broad libary and provides rich set of module and funcities forraiped application development.\n",
    "*GUI Programming Support: Graphical Uses Interface can be developed using python.\n",
    "*Integrated: It can be easily integrated with language with language like c++,JAVA,HTML,..etc."
